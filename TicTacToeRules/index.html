    <h1>Tic-Tac-Toe Rules</h1>
    <h2>These are the rules of the game</h2>
    <h3>This game can be played with 1 or 2 players.</h3>
    <h3>Players take turns marking any empty space on the 3x3 grid. Player 1 places X's and player 2 places O's.</h3>
    <h3>When someone makes a 3 space long line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, they win. If the board is filled and nobody wins, it is a tie.</h3>
    <h3>In 1 player mode, you play as Player 1 against the computer. The computer wins or ties every game.</h3>
    <h3>At the bottom of the page, it shows who's turn it is and what moves were played.</h3>
    <h3>Restart the game by reloading the page.</h3>
    <h3>The game mode button switches between 1 and 2 player mode. The autoplay button constantly plays random moves against the computer.</h3>
