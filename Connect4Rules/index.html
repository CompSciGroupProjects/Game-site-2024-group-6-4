    <h2>These are the rules to the game</h2>

<div id="rule">
    <h3> One player chooses to be green and the other one chooses to be the yellow pieces.

        Green will go first and pick any place on the last row of the board. Next yellow will go and they will go back and forth until someone wins or it is a tie.

        To win one player needs to get four in a row. This can be a vertical line, horizontal line, diagonal or anti-diagonal line.

        If the whole board is full and no one wins it is considered a tie.</h3>
