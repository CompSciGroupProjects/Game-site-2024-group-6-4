    <h1>Welcome to Connect 4</h1>
    <h2>These are the rules to the game</h2>
</div>
<div id="rule">
    <h3> One player chooses to be green and the other one chooses to be the yellow pieces.</h3>

        <h3>Green will go first and pick any place on the last row of the board. </h3>
        <h3>Next yellow will go and they will go back and forth until someone wins or it is a tie.</h3>
        <h3>To win one player needs to get four in a row. </h3>
        <h3>This can be a vertical line, horizontal line, diagonal or anti-diagonal line.</h3>
        <h3>If the whole board is full and no one wins it is considered a tie.</h3>
