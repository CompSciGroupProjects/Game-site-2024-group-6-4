<h1>Tic-Tac-Toe Rules</h1>
<p>This game can be played with 1 or 2 players.</p>
<p>Players take turns marking any empty space on the 3x3 grid. Player 1 places X's and player 2 places O's.</p>
<p>When someone makes a 3 space long line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, they win. If the board is filled and nobody wins, it is a tie.</p>
<p>In 1 player mode, you play as Player 1 against the computer. The computer wins or ties every game.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the page, it shows who's turn it is and what moves were played.</p>
<p>Restart the game by reloading the page.</p>
<p>The game mode button switches between 1 and 2 player mode. The autoplay button constantly plays random moves against the computer.</p>
